            app:getPref( name )
            
            provided there is no app:initPref( name, val ) or app:setPref( name, val ) statements executed prior,
            which hide/override the named members in this file.

_t.settlingTimePerOp = 3 -- settling time per *pre-requesite* operation - very conservatively set to 3 seconds by default. Do set this to 1 (or less) if white balance = custom
-- or lens profile enable pre-requisites do not need so much settling time.
-- also, consider setting white balance to custom, and enabling lens profile corrections upon import or conversion, to avoid this settling delay altogether - highly recommended.

_t.includeCookmarksPrefix = false -- in edit-history. Set to true to include prefix with cookmarks ID and date-timestamp.
